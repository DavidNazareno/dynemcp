## What is DyneMCP?

**DyneMCP** is a modern, modular TypeScript framework for building production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It provides a complete toolchain for rapid development, robust configuration, and scalable deployment of MCP-based applications.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
DyneMCP Server
├── Configuration Layer      # dynemcp.config.ts
├── Transport Layer          # stdio, HTTP, SSE
├── Registry System          # Dynamic component registration
├── Execution Engine         # Tool/Resource/Prompt handling
└── Build System             # esbuild-based bundling
```

- **Declarative Configuration:** All server, transport, and build options are managed in a single JSON file.
- **Component Registry:** Tools, resources, and prompts are auto-discovered and registered at runtime.
- **Multiple Transports:** Support for stdio and HTTP transports with extensible architecture.
- **Extensible:** Add custom tools, resources, prompts, and transports.
- **Optimized Build System:** Fast builds and bundling with esbuild.
- **Security:** Built-in validation, rate limiting, and CORS support.
