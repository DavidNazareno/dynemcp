description: Learn how to create and set up your first DyneMCP project - a modern, modular framework for building MCP servers.
---

DyneMCP is a modern, modular framework for building, running, and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. It provides a unified CLI, a robust build system, and a highly extensible server runtime—all designed for zero-config, production-ready workflows.

## Creating a New Project

The official way to create a new DyneMCP project is using the project generator:

```bash
pnpx create-dynemcp my-project
```

When you run the create command, you'll be guided through an interactive process that will:

1. Let you choose a template (see [Project Templates](/guides/templates))
2. Confirm your project name
3. Install all dependencies

You can also use non-interactive mode with various options:

```bash
# Use default-stdio template
pnpx create-dynemcp my-agent --template default-stdio --yes

# Use default-http template
pnpx create-dynemcp my-server --template default-http --yes

# Skip dependency installation
pnpx create-dynemcp my-agent --template default-http --yes --skip-install
```

## Project Structure

After creating a project, you'll have a structure like this:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Main entry point
│   ├── tools/                # MCP tools directory
│   │   └── *.ts              # Tool implementations
│   ├── resources/            # MCP resources directory
│   │   └── *.ts              # Resource definitions
│   └── prompts/              # MCP prompts directory
│       └── *.ts              # Prompt definitions
├── dynemcp.config.ts         # DyneMCP configuration (TypeScript recommended)
├── package.json              # Node.js dependencies
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Features

DyneMCP comes with several powerful features out of the box:

- 🎯 **Interactive CLI**: Guided project creation with prompts
- 📋 **Multiple Templates**: Choose from specialized templates for different use cases
- 📦 **Zero Configuration**: Projects work out of the box
- 🔧 **Modern Tooling**: TypeScript, ESBuild, and hot reload included
- 🌐 **Transport Options**: Support for stdio, HTTP, and streaming transports
- 🛡️ **Security Ready**: Templates with authentication and security features
- 📚 **Documentation**: Each template includes comprehensive guides

## Next Steps

Now that you have your project set up, you might want to:

1. [Explore available templates](/guides/templates) to find the best starting point for your use case
2. [Learn about the server architecture](/reference/server) to understand how DyneMCP works
3. [Check the security best practices](/guides/security) to ensure your deployment is secure
4. [Read about the build system](/reference/build-system) to optimize your builds

## Running Your Project

After project creation, run:

```bash
cd my-project
pnpm install # if you skipped install
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server.

## Why DyneMCP?

DyneMCP offers several advantages for building MCP servers:

- **Zero-config, production-ready:** No need to tweak endless configs—just build and deploy
- **Professional, modular architecture:** Easy to extend, maintain, and onboard new developers
- **Security-first:** Built-in checks and best practices to keep your deployments safe
- **Full MCP protocol compliance:** Works out of the box with all MCP clients and hosts
- **Clear documentation:** Every module and submodule is documented for clarity and maintainability
