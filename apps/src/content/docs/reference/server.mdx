# Server Architecture

DyneMCP's server runtime is designed to be fast, extensible, and robust. It follows a modular architecture that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Overview

The server module is organized into several key submodules:

```
server/
├── main/         # Core server functionality
├── api/          # API endpoints and handlers
├── registry/     # Tool and resource registration
├── config/       # Server configuration
└── communication/# Transport and protocol handling
```

## Core Components

### Main Server

The main server module provides the core functionality for running an MCP server. It handles:

- Server lifecycle management
- Request routing
- Error handling
- State management

### API Layer

The API module manages all server endpoints and request handling:

- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication middleware
- Request validation
- Response formatting

### Registry

The registry module handles tool and resource management:

- Tool registration and discovery
- Resource management
- Prompt handling
- Dynamic loading capabilities

### Configuration

The config module centralizes all server configuration:

- Environment variables
- Security settings
- Transport options
- Performance tuning

### Communication

The communication module handles all transport-related functionality:

- Protocol implementation
- Transport adapters (stdio, HTTP, streaming)
- Message formatting
- Connection management

## Security Features

DyneMCP includes robust security features out of the box:

### JWT Authentication

JWT authentication is required in production:

```typescript
// Example JWT middleware configuration
{
  expectedAudience: "your-server-id",
  // Other JWT options...
}
```

### Environment Validation

The server automatically checks critical environment variables at startup:

- Required variables are present
- Security-sensitive values are properly set
- Configuration is production-ready

### Security Headers

When using HTTP transport, security headers are automatically configured:

- CORS settings
- Content Security Policy
- XSS Protection
- Frame Options

## Extension Points

The server architecture provides several extension points:

### Custom Tools

Add new tools by implementing the Tool interface:

```typescript
interface Tool {
  name: string
  description: string
  execute(params: any): Promise<any>
}
```

### Custom Resources

Create custom resources by extending the Resource base class:

```typescript
class CustomResource extends Resource {
  async getData(): Promise<any> {
    // Resource implementation
  }
}
```

### Custom Prompts

Define custom prompts for specialized use cases:

```typescript
interface Prompt {
  name: string
  content: string
  variables?: Record<string, any>
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with the server:

1. **Async Operations**

   - Use async/await for all I/O operations
   - Handle errors properly with try/catch
   - Implement proper cleanup in finally blocks

2. **Error Handling**

   - Use typed errors for different scenarios
   - Include helpful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately

3. **Configuration**

   - Keep sensitive data in environment variables
   - Validate all configuration at startup
   - Use type-safe configuration objects

4. **Extensions**
   - Keep extensions modular and focused
   - Document extension points clearly
   - Follow the existing patterns
