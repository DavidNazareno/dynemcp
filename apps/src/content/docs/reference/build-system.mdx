# Build System

DyneMCP's build system is designed to be zero-config and production-ready out of the box. It provides a robust, type-safe build process that requires minimal configuration while maintaining high performance and optimization.

## Architecture

The build system is organized into several key modules:

```
build/
├── main/      # Core build functionality
├── bundler/   # Bundle optimization and analysis
├── config/    # Build configuration
└── bin/       # CLI tools and binaries
```

## Core Components

### Main Build System

The main build module handles:

- Build process orchestration
- File watching and rebuilding
- Error reporting
- Build optimization

### Bundler

The bundler module provides:

- Dependency analysis
- Code optimization
- Bundle size optimization
- Build manifest generation
- HTML report generation
- Shared logging system

### Configuration

The config module manages:

- Build settings
- Environment-specific configs
- Zod-based schema validation
- Zero-config philosophy implementation

### Binary Tools

The bin module includes:

- CLI tool compilation
- Binary optimization
- Platform-specific builds

## CLI Commands

DyneMCP provides several build-related commands:

```bash
# Development build with hot reload
dynemcp dev

# Production build
dynemcp build --clean

# Clean build artifacts
dynemcp clean

# Analyze dependencies
dynemcp analyze
```

## Build Configuration

While DyneMCP follows a zero-config philosophy, you can customize the build process when needed:

### Default Configuration

The default configuration is production-ready and includes:

- TypeScript support
- ESBuild-based bundling
- Automatic optimization
- Source maps
- Type checking

### Custom Configuration

If needed, you can extend the default configuration:

```typescript
// dynemcp.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'dynemcp'

export default defineConfig({
  // Your custom config here
})
```

## Build Features

### Zero Configuration

DyneMCP's build system works out of the box:

- Sensible defaults
- Production-ready settings
- Automatic optimizations
- Type safety

### Type Safety

The build system is fully type-safe:

- TypeScript integration
- Type checking during build
- Type-safe configuration
- Intelligent error messages

### Build Analysis

The analyze command provides detailed insights:

- Dependency graph
- Bundle sizes
- Import analysis
- Performance metrics

### Development Mode

Development mode includes:

- Hot reload
- Fast rebuilds
- Detailed error messages
- Source maps

## Best Practices

When working with the build system:

1. **Performance**

   - Use the clean flag for fresh builds
   - Leverage the analyze command
   - Monitor bundle sizes
   - Use code splitting when appropriate

2. **Configuration**

   - Start with zero config
   - Only add custom config when needed
   - Use type-safe configuration
   - Document any customizations

3. **Development**

   - Use dev mode during development
   - Keep the build directory clean
   - Monitor build times
   - Use appropriate source maps

4. **Production**
   - Always use --clean for production builds
   - Verify bundle sizes
   - Check optimization settings
   - Test production builds locally
