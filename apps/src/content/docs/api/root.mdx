## Utilities

- `isRoot(obj)` — Checks if an object is a valid Root.
- `isRootList(obj)` — Checks if an object is a valid list of Roots.
- `parseRootList(input)` — Parses and normalizes a list of roots from any input.

## Notes

- Roots are used to define the context or workspace for the server.
- The framework will auto-load and notify these roots to the MCP server at startup if configured.
- See the main README and templates for real-world root usage.
