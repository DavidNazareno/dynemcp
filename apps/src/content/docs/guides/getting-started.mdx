# Getting Started with DyneMCP

DyneMCP is a modern, modular framework for building, running, and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. It provides a unified CLI, a robust build system, and a highly extensible server runtime—all designed for zero-config, production-ready workflows.

## Creating a New Project

The easiest way to create a new DyneMCP project is using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dlx @dynemcp/create-dynemcp my-project
```

When you run the create command, you'll be guided through an interactive process that will:

1. Let you choose a template
2. Confirm your project name
3. Install all dependencies

You can also use non-interactive mode with various options:

```bash
# Use default template
pnpm dlx @dynemcp/create-dynemcp my-agent --yes

# Specify a template
pnpm dlx @dynemcp/create-dynemcp my-calculator --template calculator --yes

# Skip dependency installation
pnpm dlx @dynemcp/create-dynemcp my-agent --template secure-agent --yes --skip-install
```

## Project Structure

After creating a project, you'll have a structure like this:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Main entry point
│   ├── tools/                # MCP tools directory
│   │   └── *.ts              # Tool implementations
│   ├── resources/            # MCP resources directory
│   │   └── *.ts              # Resource definitions
│   └── prompts/              # MCP prompts directory
│       └── *.ts              # Prompt definitions
├── dynemcp.config.json       # DyneMCP configuration
├── package.json              # Node.js dependencies
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Features

DyneMCP comes with several powerful features out of the box:

## Next Steps

Now that you have your project set up, you might want to:

1. [Explore available templates](/guides/templates) to find the best starting point for your use case
2. [Learn about the server architecture](/reference/server) to understand how DyneMCP works
3. [Check the security best practices](/guides/security) to ensure your deployment is secure
4. [Read about the build system](/reference/build-system) to optimize your builds

## Why DyneMCP?

DyneMCP offers several advantages for building MCP servers:

- **Zero-config, production-ready:** No need to tweak endless configs—just build and deploy
- **Professional, modular architecture:** Easy to extend, maintain, and onboard new developers
- **Security-first:** Built-in checks and best practices to keep your deployments safe
