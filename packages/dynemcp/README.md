# DyneMCP

**DyneMCP** is a modern, modular framework for building, running, and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. It provides a unified CLI, a robust build system, and a highly extensible server runtimeâ€”all designed for zero-config, production-ready workflows.

---

## Features

- **Unified CLI**: One command-line tool for development, build, analysis, and server management.
- **Modular Build System**: Type-safe, zero-config, and production-focused. Supports build, watch, clean, analyze, and CLI tool bundling.
- **Extensible Server Runtime**: Fast, robust, and ready for custom tools, resources, and prompts.
- **Professional Project Structure**: Each concern (build, server, config, CLI) is isolated and documented.
- **Best Practices**: Minimal public API, async/await everywhere, and clear separation of concerns.

## Main Modules

### 1. CLI (`src/cli/`)

- Unified entrypoint for all developer commands: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `clean`, `analyze`.
- Modular, type-safe, and easy to extend.
- See [`src/cli/README.md`](./src/cli/README.md) for details.

### 2. Build System (`src/build/`)

- Handles all build, watch, clean, analyze, and CLI bundling tasks.
- Zero-config: always uses a default, production-ready config.
- See [`src/build/README.md`](./src/build/README.md) for details.

### 3. Server (`src/server/`)

- The DyneMCP server runtime: fast, extensible, and robust.
- Supports custom tools, resources, and prompts.
- See [`src/server/README.md`](./src/server/README.md) for details.

### 4. Global Config (`src/global/config-all-contants.ts`)

- Centralized, minimal set of constants and helpers shared across modules.

## Usage

### Install

```sh
npm install dynemcp
# or
yarn add dynemcp
# or
pnpm add dynemcp
```

### CLI Examples

```sh
# Start dev server
dynemcp dev

# Start dev server with Inspector
dynemcp dev inspector

# Build for production
dynemcp build --clean

# Start production server
dynemcp start

# Clean build directory
dynemcp clean

# Analyze dependencies
dynemcp analyze
```

---

## Extending DyneMCP

- Add new CLI commands in `src/cli/core/cli.ts`.
- Add new build tasks in `src/build/main/core/`.
- Add new server features in `src/server/main/core/`.
- Use the global config for shared constants only.
- Keep all implementation logic in `core/` folders; only re-export from `index.ts`.

---

## Best Practices

- Expose only the minimal public API at the top level.
- Use async/await for all I/O and process management.
- Keep command handlers and entrypoints minimal; delegate logic to helpers or submodules.
- Document new commands, options, and modules in their respective READMEs.
